# Python Learning Repository

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-4%2F30-brightgreen)

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is for my own learning — to explore Python topics that go beyond what’s usually covered in typical courses.  
It’s a place for me to experiment, take notes, and deepen my understanding of the language and its advanced concepts.

## References
I’m using the following resources as references and learning guides:

- [*Python — Learn By Example*](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-introduction/)

## Contents
This repository may include:
- Practice scripts and exercises  
- Notes and examples from the learning resources  
- Personal experiments with Python features and libraries
